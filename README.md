JANUS avionics task submission - Niva 

Task1 - Avionics 
This repository contains the solutions for the JANUS avionics tasks. It includes Python scripts to analyze pressure data, calculate altitude and velocity, and generate animations.
Problem Statement One 
1) Converted the Pressure reading into Altitude using the barometric formula
2) Converted the excel into csv, to plot the values
3) Used the Scipy-savgol filter to reduce the noise and make the real data plotable
4) Created animated plots, Altitude vs time, Velocity vs time using matplotlib's animation function
5) Dependancies installed - pandas, numpy, scipy, matplotlib
6) Also used functions like intrapolate and errors to ignore the non numeric values and convert them into NaNs.
